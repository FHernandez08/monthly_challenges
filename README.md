The completion of the Challenges Project

It was a part of the Python Django - The Practical Guide (Udemy Course)

It involved two major topics from Django:
  1. URLs and Views
  2. Templates and Static Files

Throughout this project, as I followed along, I felt that I was able to grasp the understanding of each topic that was explained as I was able to practice by going a few steps ahead of the instructor, to assure myself that I was doing it correctly.

This is the first of a few projects that would be done in this course.

Stay Tuned!
